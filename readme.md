A simple Python server that fetches comments from Scratch and executes them as shell commands.

## DISCLAIMER: Use at your own risk. I've had one Scratch account shadow banned and another muted while testing the server.

# Requirements
* Python 3
* Your Scratch session token. See https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach/wiki/Get-your-session-id for a guide on how to get it.

# Usage
1. Clone repository.
2. Run setup.py. It will install the required packages and guide you through server configuration.
And that's it. It should just work.
